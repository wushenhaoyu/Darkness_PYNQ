5. Debug Commands
-----------------

  The following debug information can be passed to Vivado as Tcl commands,
in order to validate or debug the output of the upgrade flow.
  You may consult any warnings from within this upgrade, and alter or remove

5. Debug Commands
-----------------

  The following debug information can be passed to Vivado as Tcl commands,
in order to validate or debug the output of the upgrade flow.
  You may consult any warnings from within this upgrade, and alter or remove
the configuration parameter(s) which caused the warning; then execute the Tcl
commands, and use the IP Customization GUI to verify the IP configuration.
